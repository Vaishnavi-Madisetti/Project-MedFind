# Project-MedFind

The traditional way of buying any medicine is to go and search for a particular medicine in the nearby medical stores,
which usually takes a lot of manual work and ultimately increases time and the cost incurred. The medicine required by
the customer at a particular time may or may not be available in the store he visits.

To solve this problem, we have thought of a solution which brings the store owner and the user on to a single platform.
This web application gives the user a complete support for finding the medicines online, without any difficulty.
